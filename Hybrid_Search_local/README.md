# Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain

This project demonstrates a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using LangChain, HuggingFace, and Ollama. The system loads PDF documents, splits them into chunks, creates embeddings, and uses both vector-based and keyword-based retrieval methods to answer questions.
