It holds the Guinness World Record for the highest known painting insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962, equivalent to $1 billion as of 2023.\\n\\n\\n== Title and subject ==\\n\\nThe title of the painting, which is known in English as Mona Lisa, is based on the presumption that it depicts Lisa del Giocondo, although her likeness is uncertain. Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna—similar to Ma\\'am, Madam, or my lady in English. This became madonna, and its contraction monna. The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled Mona.\\nLisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means \"jocund\" (\"happy\" or \"jovial\"), or literally \"the jocund one\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa\\'s married name, Giocondo. In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning. Vasari\\'s account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist\\'s death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo\\'s assistant Salaì, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo\\'s contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document,'),\n",

But as George and Simone find out more about each other, they form a friendship, and George begins to fall in love with her. George agrees, at the risk of his own life, to help Simone find her teenage friend Cathy, who has disappeared, and who Simone fears is being abused by her violent former pimp, Anderson.\\nGeorge increasingly finds himself torn between his feelings for Simone, his obligations to his boss Mortwell, and his relationship with his teenage daughter Jeannie, a sweet normal girl who has matured while he was in prison and wants to have her father in her life.\\nWhen Anderson stalks Simone to her flat and tries to slash her, George takes her to the secluded garage where he lives with his friend Thomas and then finds the drug-addled Cathy.

Among the pupils of Leonardo, Salaì or Francesco Melzi are the most plausible authors of the Prado\\'s version, though other experts argue that the painting could have been executed by one of Leonardo\\'s Spanish students.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nThe origins of the Prado\\'s Mona Lisa are linked to those of Leonardo\\'s original, as both paintings were likely created simultaneously in the same studio. The first documentary reference was made in the 1666 inventory in the Galleria del Mediodia of the Alcazar in Madrid as Mujer de mano de Leonardo Abince (Woman by Leonardo da Vinci\\'s hand). However, it is still unknown when the portrait entered the Spanish Royal Collection, though it could have been already in Spain in the early years of the 17th century. Since the Prado\\'s founding in 1819, the copy has been part of its permanent collection.\\n\\n\\n== Restoration ==\\n\\nPrevious to its restoration, the painting was catalogued as an anonymous copy from the first quarter of the 16th century. However, it usually hung in the Prado alongside masterpieces of Italian artists such as Raphael or Andrea del Sarto. A lithograph of the painting also exists, which is unusual for an anonymous copy.\\nAlthough there were elements that clearly distinguished the copy from the Louvre\\'s version, the most striking point was the fact that until the restoration of the Prado\\'s version, no landscape background was visible. That landscape was fully recovered through the restoration carried out by the Prado between 2011 and 2012, for a request to include the Prado\\'s work in a temporary exhibition in the Louvre called Leonardo\\'s last masterpiece: The Sainte Anne, from 29 March to 25 June 2012. The oxidized varnishes indicated that the black repaint had been made 200 years after the copy was painted, that is to say, not before 1750. \\nDuring this restoration process, the copy was also submitted to a study of infrared reflectography and radiography, where the results revealed that the painting had been made in the workshop of Leonardo da Vinci at the same time the original Mona Lisa was painted. The \"key\" of this discovery was the underlying drawing, as it is the same but with different style in both paintings, as well as the drawing\\'s corrections.\\nThese findings, coupled with the excellent state of preservation in regard to the Louvre\\'s version, show the original colours of the Prado\\'s painting and indicates what the copy must have originally looked like, as the varnish on the original has become cracked and yellowed with age. It is anticipated that such revelations also may offer further insight into Leonardo\\'s original.\\n\\nThe suggestion that the Prado version was painted in the workshop of Leonardo at the same time as the Louvre version, presumably by an apprentice, is supported by the observation that it appears to have been rendered from a slightly different perspective than the original. This has fuelled speculation that the pair may constitute the world’s first stereoscopic image, and hence when viewed dichoptically (i.e. with the Prado version viewed by the left eye, and the Louvre version by the right) may produce a distinct 3D appearance. This possibility is plausible, given the fact that Leonardo di'),\n",

In London, she is cared for by one of her father\\'s retainers, who is also a powerful member of the London Mob. She meets Molly Millions (having altered her appearance and now calling herself \"Sally Shears\", in order to conceal her identity from hostile parties who are implied to be pursuing her), who takes the girl under her wing.\\nThread three: follows a reclusive artist named Slick Henry, who lives in a place named Factory in the Dog Solitude; a large, poisoned expanse of deserted factories and dumps, probably in southern New Jersey. Slick Henry is a convicted car thief whose punishment consisted of having his short-term memory erased every five minutes, leading to continuous confusion and dissociation. Following the end of his sentence, he spends his days creating large robotic sculptures and periodically suffers episodes of time loss, returning to consciousness afterward with no memory of what he did during the blackout. He is hired by an acquaintance to look after the comatose \"Count\" (Bobby Newmark from the second novel, Count Zero, who has hooked himself into a super-capacity cyber-bio harddrive called an Aleph).\\nA theoretical \"Aleph\" would have the RAM capacity to literally contain all of reality, enough that a memory construct of a person would contain the complete personality of the individual and allow it to learn, grow and act independently.\\nThe final plotline follows Angela Mitchell, famous simstim star, and the girl from the second Sprawl novel Count Zero. Angie, thanks to brain manipulations by her father when she was a child, has always had the ability to access cyberspace directly (without a cyberspace deck), but drugs provided by her production company Sense/Net have severely impeded this ability.\\nThe plot culminates when Angie and Bobby \"upload\" their consciousness into the Aleph, on the verge of visiting an alien artificial intelligence apparently found on a planet orbiting Centauri. Mona takes Angie\\'s place as a simstim star following forced cosmetic surgery to make Mona look identical to Angie.\\n\\n\\n== Influences ==\\nThe story of the reclusive artist who makes cybernetic sculptures is a reference to Mark Pauline of Survival Research Labs.\\nThe name of the dense lump of cybernetic hardware that Bobby Newmark\\'s consciousness is jacked into is a direct reference to the short story \"The Aleph\" by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges. The titular Aleph is a point in space which contains all other points, and if one were to gaze into the Aleph one would be able to see or experience the entirety of existence.\\n\\n\\n== Reception ==\\nThomas M. Disch reviewed the novel for the New York Times, giving it a mixed review: \"Only in retrospect, however, is Mona Lisa Overdrive a disappointment. Zing by zing, its 45 chapters provide a sufficiency of non-nutritive fun.\" It received positive reviews in Kirkus Reviews and '),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'title': 'Speculations about Mona Lisa', 'summary': 'The 16th-century portrait Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda (La Joconde), painted in oil on a poplar panel by Leonardo da Vinci, has been the subject of a considerable deal of speculation.\\n\\n', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculations_about_Mona_Lisa'}, page_content='The 16th-century portrait Mona Lisa, or La Gioconda (La Joconde), painted in oil on a poplar panel by Leonardo da Vinci, has been the subject of a considerable deal of speculation.\\n\\n\\n== Columns and trimming ==\\n\\nIt has for a long time been argued that after Leonardo\\'s death the painting was cut down by having part of the panel at both sides removed. Early copies depict columns on both sides of the figure. Only the edges of the bases can be seen in the original. However, some art historians, such as Martin Kemp, now argue that the painting has not been altered, and that the columns depicted in the copies were added by the copyists. The latter view was bolstered during 2004 and 2005 when an international team of 39 specialists undertook the most thorough scientific examination of the Mona Lisa yet undertaken. Beneath the frame (the current one was fitted to the Mona Lisa in 2004) there was discovered a \"reserve\" around all four edges of the panel. A reserve is an area of bare wood surrounding the gessoed and painted portion of the panel. That this is a genuine reserve, and not the result of removal of the gesso or paint, is demonstrated by a raised edge still existing around the gesso, the result of build up from the edge of brush strokes at the edge of the gesso area.\\nThe reserve area, which was likely to have been as much as 20 mm (0.79 in) originally appears to have been trimmed at some point probably to fit a frame (in the 1906 framing it was the frame itself that was trimmed, not the picture, so it must have been earlier), however at no point has any of Leonardo\\'s actual paint been trimmed. Therefore, the columns in early copies must be inventions of those artists, or copies of another (unknown) studio version of Mona Lisa. \\n\\n\\n== Landscape ==\\nPeople of Arezzo in the Val di Chiana, a valley in Tuscany, have traditionally claimed the Mona Lisa landscape as theirs.  An article published in the journal Cartographica suggests that the landscape consists of two parts which when placed together correspond to Leonardo\\'s topographic map, the Val di Chiana.\\n\\n\\n== Other versions ==\\n\\nIt has been suggested that Leonardo created more than one version of the painting. Another contender is the Isleworth Mona Lisa, which had been hidden in a Swiss bank vault for 40 years before being unveiled to the public on September 27, 2012. The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich has dated the piece to Leonardo\\'s lifetime, and an expert in sacred geometry says it conforms to the artist\\'s basic line structures.\\nThe same claim has been made for a version in the Vernon collection. The Vernon Mona Lisa is particularly interesting because it was originally part of the collection at the Louvre. Another version, dating from c. 1616, was given in c. 1790 to Joshua Reynolds by the Duke of Leeds in exchange for a Reynolds self-portrait. Reynolds thought it to be the real painting and the French one a copy, which has now been disproved. It is, however, useful in that it was copied when the original\\'s colors were far brighter than they are now, and so it gives some sense of the original\\'s appearance \\'as new\\'. It is in a private collection, but was  exhibited in 2006 at the Dulwich Picture Gallery.\\nIn January 2012 Museo del Prado in Madrid found a copy of the painting, believed by a pupil of Leonardo, which may have been painted in Leonardo\\'s presence. The copy gives a better indication of what the portrait looked like at the time, as the varnish on the original has become cracked and yellowed with age.\\nGerman imaging researchers Claus-Christian Carbon of the University of Bamberg and Vera Hesslinger of the University of Mainz performed further analysis of the Museo del Prado version, comparing it to Da Vinci\\'s Mona Lisa, and in May 2014 speculated that, based on perspective analysis of key features in the images, the two images were painted at the same time from slightly different viewpoints. They further proposed that two images may therefore form a ste'),\n",

They were well off but not wealthy, and lived on a farm income in a city where there were great disparities in wealth among inhabitants. Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini, Lisa's father, came from a family who had lived on properties near San Donato in Poggio and only recently moved to the city. Gherardini at one time owned or rented six farms in Chianti that produced wheat, wine, and olive oil and where livestock was raised.\\nIn 1465, Gherardini married Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de' Carducci, and in 1473 remarried to Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai; both of them died in childbirth. Lisa's mother was Lucrezia del Caccia, daughter of Piera Spinelli, and Gherardini's wife by his third marriage in 1476. Lisa was born in Florence on June 15, 1479, on Via Maggio, although for many years it was thought she was born on Villa Vignamaggio just outside Greve, one of the family's rural properties. She was named for Lisa, a wife of her paternal grandfather. The eldest of seven children, Lisa had three sisters, one of whom was named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.\\nThe family lived in Florence, originally near Santa Trinita and later in rented space near Santo Spirito, likely because they were unable to afford repairs when their first house was damaged. Lisa's family moved to what today is called Via dei Pepi, and then near Santa Croce, where they lived near Ser Piero da Vinci, Leonardo's father. They also owned a small country home in San Donato in the village of Poggio about 32 kilometres (20 mi) south of the city. Noldo, Gherardini's father and Lisa's grandfather, had bequeathed a farm in Chianti to the Santa Maria Nuova hospital. Gherardini secured a lease for another of the hospital's farms; the family spent summers there at the house named Ca' di Pesa, so that Gherardini could oversee the wheat harvest.\\n\\n\\n== Marriage and later life ==\\nOn March 5, 1495, 15-year-old Lisa married 29-year-old Francesco di Bartolomeo del Giocondo, an ambitious cloth and silk merchant, becoming his second wife. Her age at marriage was around the norm for Florentine women of the time, who often married men ten or more years their senior. Because her father had not participated in the custom of saving cash at a daughter's birth that compounded interest for dowries, Lisa's dowry was land: her father's most valuable property in Chianti, the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, which lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by Michelangelo. The farm was valued at 400 florins, and its contents at 170 florins. The modest dowry may be a sign that the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time. Art historian Frank Zöllner says the dowry's small size lends reason to think Francesco may have had true affection for Lisa.\\nNeither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a comfortable middle-class life.

Attorneys have also lauded the film for its accurate depiction of criminal procedure and trial strategy.\\n\\n\\n== Plot ==\\nWhile driving through Alabama, New York college students Bill Gambini and Stan Rothenstein stop at a convenience store, during which Bill accidentally shoplifts a can of tuna. After they leave, the boys are pulled over and arrested as the shopkeeper has been found robbed and murdered. At the police station, Bill assumes he has been arrested for shoplifting and confesses to being responsible, resulting in him being charged with first-degree murder and Stan as an accessory. Unable to afford a private lawyer, Bill asks for help from his cousin Vinny Gambini, a personal injury lawyer from Brooklyn, who agrees to help the boys. However, they are unaware that Vinny has only just passed the bar to become a lawyer, after multiple failed attempts, and has no trial experience. Vinny promptly arrives in Alabama with his fiancée Mona Lisa Vito.\\nVinny fools the trial judge, Chamberlain Haller, into believing he is an experienced New York lawyer who works under the alias Jerry Callo. Haller repeatedly holds Vinny in contempt for his unprofessional attire, attitude, and ignorance of courtroom decorum, resulting in brief stints in jail. The prosecuting district attorney, Jim Trotter III, presents a strong—although circumstantial—case against the boys, offering multiple witnesses to their involvement in the murder. Bill and Stan become concerned when Vinny declines to cross-examine the witnesses during the preliminary hearing, resulting in Stan firing Vinny and hiring the public defender, John Gibbons.\\nVinny's inexperience with the legal system leads him to try to trick Trotter into sharing his evidence until Lisa tells Vinny that he legally can access the prosecution's evidence and prompts him to interview the witnesses, which he does. She grows frustrated with Vinny as he promised several years earlier that they would get married when he wins his first case and is worried he never will. Vinny is also eager to prove himself to his mentor Judge Malloy, who convinced him to go into law.\\nDuring the trial, Gibbons's nerves and severe stutter only further damage Stan's defense. Meanwhile, Vinny uses an aggressive but perceptive questioning style to discredit Trotter's witnesses, using his knowledge of the cooking time of grits to force one to admit that his perception of when the crime occurred is inaccurate, and the others by questioning their ability to positively identify the suspects due to obstructions in their sightline and impaired vision. Stan promptly rehires Vinny to defend him.\\nThe next day, Trotter produces a surprise witness, FBI analyst George Wilbur, who testifies that tire markings at the crime scene match those on the boys' 1964 Buick Skylark, although Vinny makes him admit that the tires are the most used in America.

He was described as one of Leonardo\\'s students and lifelong companion and servant and was the model for Leonardo\\'s St. John the Baptist, Bacchus, and Angelo incarnato.\\n\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n\\nSalaì was born in 1480 as son of Pietro di Giovanni, a tenant of Leonardo\\'s vineyard near the Porta Vercellina, Milan. \\nSalai joined Leonardo\\'s household at the age of ten as an assistant. Giorgio Vasari describes Salaì as \"a graceful and beautiful youth with curly hair, in which Leonardo greatly delighted\". Although Leonardo described him as \"a liar, a thief, stubborn, and a glutton\" and he stole from Leonardo on at least five occasions, he kept Salaì in his household for more than 25 years, in which Salaì trained as an artist. Salaì became a capable, although not very impressive, painter, who created several works, including the Monna Vanna, a nude version of the Mona Lisa which may be based on a charcoal sketch by Leonardo. He is also considered to be a potential creator of the Prado\\'s copy of the Mona Lisa. Walter Isaacson, an author, says in his opinion Leonardo had a homosexual relationship with Salai.\\nLeonardo is thought to have used Salaì as the model for several of his works, specifically St. John the Baptist, Bacchus and Angelo Incarnato. Some researchers also believe that Salaì–and not Lisa del Giocondo–was the real model for the Mona Lisa, but this claim is disputed by the Louvre.\\n\\nDuring Leonardo\\'s second stay in Milan, he took another young pupil, Francesco Melzi. Unlike Salaì, Francesco was a son of a nobleman. When Leonardo traveled to Rome in 1513 and to France in 1516, Salaì and Melzi both accompanied him. As an adult, Melzi became secretary and main assistant of Leonardo, and undertook to prepare Leonardo\\'s writings for publication. Vasari wrote that Melzi \"at the time of Leonardo was a very beautiful and very much loved young man\". In France, Francesco Melzi was greeted as \"Italian gentleman living with master Leonardo\" and granted donation of 400 ecus, while Salaì, 36 years old, was described as \"servant\" and granted a one time donation of 100 ecus.\\nSalaì left France and Leonardo, in 1518. Salai later returned to Milan to work on Leonardo\\'s vineyard, previously worked by Salaì\\'s father, half of which was granted to him in Leonardo\\'s will. It is commonly believed that upon Leonardo\\'s death in 1519, Salaì inherited several paintings including the Mona Lisa. Through his estate, many of those works notably the Mona Lisa, passed into the possession of Francis I of France. While Leonardo left all personal belongings, paintings, drawings and notes to Francesco Melzi in his will, it is unclear whether this included the Mona Lisa.\\nOn 14 June 1523, at age 43, Salaì married Bianca Coldirodi d\\'Annono. Salaì died in 1524 as a result of a wound received from a crossbow in a duel and was buried in Milan on 10 March 1524.\\n\\n\\n== Salaì\\'s sexuality ==\\n\\nA number of drawings among the works of Leonardo and his pupils make reference to Salaì\\'s sexuality.  There is a drawing modelled on Leonardo\\'s painting John the Baptist and called The Angel Incarnate (Angelo incarnato), of a young man nude with an erect phallus, and representing Salaì. It is accepted as by Leonardo\\'s hand. The face of the figure is closer to Salaì\\'s copy of Leonardo\\'s painting John the Baptist, than to the original in the Louvre. \\nLeonardo‘s folio Codex Atlanticus includes two pages (132 and 133, verso) of drawings by a hand other than Leonardo\\'s, one of which is a crudely drawn sketch depicting an anus, identified as \"Salaì\\'s bum\", pursued by penises on legs.\\n\\n\\n== Relationship to the Mona Lisa ==\\nA group of Italian researchers has claimed that Salaì was the model for the Mona Lisa, noting the similarity in some of the '),\n",

Known for their YouTube video covers of songs by the Beatles and other 1960s bands, many of which have been issued on a series of albums, they also have released three albums of original songs, inspired by the music of the 1960s. They have toured with Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel, performed with them at the Glastonbury Festival in 2017, collaborated with American musician John Sebastian, and held a two-year residency at the Cavern Club.\\nThe band's producer is the twins' father, Rudolf Wagner, who also plays the bass and piano, and co-writes and arranges their music, which is recorded in the Wagner family's own music studio. Rudolf's wife and the twins' stepmother, Michaela Wagner, is the band's manager and assistant. The family lived in a small village in the Groß-Enzersdorf municipality near Vienna until 2014, when they moved to a suburb of Liverpool.\\nThe band typically has a four-person line-up for live concerts, with Mona and Lisa Wagner mostly playing guitars, and some harmonica and ukulele, respectively, on stage, while being backed by different bassists and drummers. In 2012 and 2013, while they were still based in Austria, those musicians were usually Michael Mozeth (bass) and Philipp Wolf (drums). Since 2014, including the two-year residency at the Cavern Club, they have been backed by several local British musicians.\\n\\n\\n== Musical style and development ==\\n\\n\\n=== Genres ===\\nThe Twins started interpreting rock and roll hits from the 1960s and 1970s, including some folk songs. Throughout their career, they have created their original songs in the style of rock & roll and rock pop, but also ballads, paired with quality video clips. Both work symbiotically as a team in their audio and video recordings.\\n\\n\\n=== Influences ===\\nThe MonaLisa Twins have been particularly influenced by the Beatles. They are known for their covers of Beatles hits, but are also influenced and inspired by rock and pop from other artists and bands of the time. Their original music has also been primarily moved by rock and pop from the 1960s and 1970s, usually having the presence of an electric guitar in both their covers and original songs.\\nThe Beatles' press officer, Tony Barrow, has praised the duo, particularly their vocal harmonies.\\n\\n\\n== Discography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Albums ===\\n2007 – MonaLisa & Band, Live in Concert (double CD)\\n2012 – When We're Together (also DVD)\\n2014 – Play Beatles & More\\n2017 – Orange\\n2018 – Play Beatles & More Vol.2\\n2018 – Play Beatles & More Vol.3\\n2019 – Christmas\\n2020 – The Duo Sessions\\n2020 – Live at The Cavern Club (double CD)\\n2022 – Why?\\n2023 – The Duo Sessions II\\n\\n\\n=== EP ===\\n2008 – California Dreaming\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nOfficial website\\nYouTube channel\"),\n",

As a song written before the band even began recording their second album, Pretty. Odd., it proved to be an inspiration for the production of Vices & Virtues. \"A few of the ideas — like \"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\", specifically — was from an idea I had probably four years ago, before we even started touring on Pretty. Odd., and it was just sitting in my laptop collecting figurative dust on my hard drive, not really doing much,\" said Urie. \"That ended up being a really good intro to the whole process.\" \"I showed the band a couple times,\" said Urie, \"but it just fell to the wayside, we never did anything with it. Other ideas beat it out or whatever reason it was.” He wrote the song dealing with his own personal convictions and struggles. \"On the surface it can seem like just the story of drama between a guy and a girl,\" explains Urie. \"But it\\'s really about what I\\'ve been going through, an inner-struggle within myself, and fighting the dualities of my personality -- the side that fucks everything up and destroys everything and the other side that tries to pick up the slack. It\\'s all growing pains.\" The song was also inspired by Urie\\'s move from Las Vegas, Nevada, where he\\'s lived his entire life, to Santa Monica, California, with Panic! drummer Spencer Smith. Urie notes that the move was \"a huge part of growing up.\"\\nMusically, the song is similar to those produced for the band\\'s debut album, A Fever You Can\\'t Sweat Out (2005); however, Urie explained in a 2011 interview that the song represented more of a new beginning. Urie said \"It was a new start when Spencer Smith and I started writing, so it was gonna end up sounding different, sonically.\" The music has been described as a combination of buzzsaw riffs, punchy percussion and literate, multi-layered lyrics. The song\\'s title is an allusion to Mona Lisa, the famous Renaissance-era oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci. In a 2011 interview, Urie regarded the name and theme of the song as neither male nor female. “That whole thing with Mona Lisa was the idea that there is this character. For us, you look at the painting, and you can’t tell what this person is thinking. Not showing too much emotion, there’s this Mona Lisa smile masking what’s going on in that person’s head,\" he explained. \"The song is about a battle in yourself […] an inner struggle in oneself. The duality in nature, where you see yourself as a bad person, and the good person trying to correct your bad habits. That’s what it was about. We thought that would be an easy way to describe how we were masking our own emotions and trying to figure out how we can solve the bad choices we make.\"\\n\\n\\n== Release ==\\nThe single was announced in the December 2010 issue of Alternative Press. The track was originally titled \"Mona Lisa\", and was originally due for January 2011. On January 17, 2011, Fueled by Ramen posted a 30-second clip of the track on their Tumblr and YouTube accounts. On January 21, 2011, the song leaked in its entirety, and Panic! at the Disco released a lyric video on YouTube on January 24, 2011. Shortly after its February 1 debut on the iTunes Store, the single shot to #1 on iTunes\\' \"Top Alternative Songs\" chart, and remained a top ten favorite for the weeks following.

Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler came up with the idea for the painting and the work's source image was taken from a brochure published by the museum. \\nIn May 2015, Warhol's painting sold for $56.2 million at Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale, surpassing its high estimate of $35 million.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nMona Lisa replicas and reinterpretations\\n\\n\\n== References ==\"),\n",

(French pronunciation: [ɛl aʃ o o ky]) is a work of art by Marcel Duchamp.

The readymade involves taking mundane, often utilitarian objects not generally considered to be art and transforming them, by adding to them, changing them, or (as in the case of his most famous work Fountain) simply renaming and reorienting them and placing them in an appropriate setting. In L.H.O.O.Q. the found object (objet trouvé) is a cheap postcard reproduction of Leonardo da Vinci\\'s early 16th-century painting Mona Lisa onto which Duchamp drew a moustache and beard in pencil and appended the title.\\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\n\\nThe subject of the Mona Lisa treated satirically had already been explored in 1887 by Eugène Bataille (aka Sapeck) when he created Mona Lisa smoking a pipe, published in Le Rire. It is not clear if Duchamp was familiar with Bataille\\'s interpretation.\\nThe name of the piece, L.H.O.O.Q., is a gramogram; the letters pronounced in French sound like \"Elle a chaud au cul\", \"She is hot in the arse\", or \"She has a hot ass\"; \"avoir chaud au cul\" is a vulgar expression implying that a woman has sexual restlessness. In a late interview (Schwarz 203), Duchamp gives a loose translation of L.H.O.O.Q. as \"there is fire down below\".\\nFrancis Picabia, in an attempt to publish L.H.O.O.Q. in his magazine 391 could not wait for the work to be sent from New York City, so with the permission of Duchamp, drew the moustache on Mona Lisa himself (forgetting the goatee). Picabia wrote underneath \"Tableau Dada par Marcel Duchamp\". Duchamp noticed the missing goatee. Two decades later, Duchamp corrected the omission on Picabia\\'s replica, found by Jean Arp at a bookstore. Duchamp drew the goatee in black ink with a fountain pen, and wrote \"Moustache par Picabia / barbiche par Marcel Duchamp / avril 1942\".\\nAs was the case with a number of his readymades, Duchamp made multiple versions of L.H.O.O.Q. of differing sizes and in different media throughout his career, one of which, an unmodified black and white reproduction of the Mona Lisa mounted on card, is called L.H.O.O.Q. Shaved. The masculinized female introduces the theme of gender reversal, which was popular with Duchamp, who adopted his own female pseudonym, Rrose Sélavy, pronounced \"Eros, c\\'est la vie\" (\"Eros, that\\'s life\").\\nPrimary responses to L.H.O.O.Q. interpreted its meaning as being an attack on the iconic Mona Lisa and traditional art, a stroke of épater le bourgeois promoting the Dadaist ideals. According to one commentator:\\n\\nThe creation of L.H.O.O.Q. profoundly transformed the perception of La Joconde (what the French call the painting, in contrast with the Americans and Germans, who call it the Mona Lisa). In 1919 the cult of Jocondisme was practically a secular religion of the French bourgeoisie and an important part of their self image as patrons of the arts. They regarded the painting with reverence, and Duchamp\\'s salacious comment and defacement was a major stroke of epater le bourgeois (\"freaking out\" or substantially offending the bourgeois). \\n\\nAccording to Rhonda R. Shearer the apparent reproduction is in fact a copy partly modelled on Duchamp\\'s own face.\\n\\n\\n== Parodies of Duchamp\\'s parodic Mona Lisa ==\\n\\n\\n=== Pre-Internet era ===\\nSalvador Dalí created his Self Portrait as Mona Lisa in 1954, referencing L.H.O.O.Q. in collaboration with Philippe Halsman. This work incorporated photographs of a wild-eyed Dalí showing his handlebar moustache and a handful of coins.\\nIcelandic painter Erró then incorporated Dalí\\'s version of L.H.O.O.Q. into a 1958 composition that also included a film-still from Buñuel\\'s Un Chien Andalou.\\nFernand Léger and René Magritte have also adapted L.H.O.O.Q., using their own iconography.\\n\\n\\n=== Internet and computerized parodies ===\\nThe use of computers permitted new forms of parodies of L.H.O.O.Q., including interactive ones.\\nOne form of c')]"

Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna—similar to Ma\\'am, Madam, or my lady in English. This became madonna, and its contraction monna. The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled Mona.\\nLisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means \"jocund\" (\"happy\" or \"jovial\"), or literally \"the jocund one\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa\\'s married name, Giocondo. In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning. Vasari\\'s account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist\\'s death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo\\'s assistant Salaì, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo\\'s contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.

Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote that \"Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife.\" Monna in Italian is a polite form of address originating as ma donna—similar to Ma\\'am, Madam, or my lady in English. This became madonna, and its contraction monna. The title of the painting is spelled in Italian as Monna Lisa (mona being a vulgarity in Italian), which is rare in English, where it is traditionally spelled Mona.\\nLisa del Giocondo was a member of the Gherardini family of Florence and Tuscany, and the wife of wealthy Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. The painting is thought to have been commissioned for their new home, and to celebrate the birth of their second son, Andrea. The Italian name for the painting, La Gioconda, means \"jocund\" (\"happy\" or \"jovial\"), or literally \"the jocund one\", a pun on the feminine form of Lisa\\'s married name, Giocondo. In French, the title La Joconde has the same meaning. Vasari\\'s account of the Mona Lisa comes from his biography of Leonardo published in 1550, 31 years after the artist\\'s death. It has long been the best-known source of information on the provenance of the work and identity of the sitter. Leonardo\\'s assistant Salaì, at his death in 1524, owned a portrait which in his personal papers was named la Gioconda, a painting bequeathed to him by Leonardo.\\nThat Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo\\'s contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.
